Open the DCC GARCH PROJECT.R script provided in this repository.

Ensure the file path for Book1.xlsx in the script matches your local directory.

Run the script to perform the DCC-GARCH-MIDAS estimation.

The script will automatically generate the volatility models and correlation plots, which should match the result shown in Output DCC GARCH EMAS DAN INDEKS S&P500.png.
